    abstract = { This paper asks whether a textbook Phillips curve can explain the behavior of core
inflation in the euro area. A critical feature of the analysis is that we measure core
inflation with the weighted median of industry inflation rates, which is less volatile
than the common measure of inflation excluding food and energy prices. We find
that fluctuations in core inflation since the creation of the euro are well explained by
three factors: expected inflation (as measured by surveys of forecasters); the output
gap (as measured by the OECD); and the pass-through of movements in headline
inflation. Our specification resolves the puzzle of a “missing disinflation” after the
Great Recession, and it diminishes the puzzle of a “missing inflation” during the recent
economic recovery. }

the passthrough of labor costs to price inflation has evolved over time in U.S. data.
We find little evidence that changes in labor costs have had a material effect on
price inflation in recent years, even for compensation measures where some degree
of passthrough to prices still appears to be present. Our results cast doubt on explanations of recent inflation behavior that appeal to such mechanisms as downward
nominal wage rigidity or a differential contribution of long-term and short-term unemployed workers to wage and price pressures.}",

THE ROLE OF THE WAGE-PRICE PASS-THROUGH},

	year = {2020}
	abstract = {Price inflation in the U.S. has been sluggish and slow to pick up in the last two decades. We show
that this missing inflation can be traced to a growing disconnect between unemployment and core
goods inflation. We exploit rich industry-level data to show that weakening pass-through from
wages to prices in the goods-producing sector is an important source of the slow inflation pick-up
in the last two decades. We set up a theoretical framework where markups and pass-through are a
function of firms' market shares and show that increased import competition and rising market
concentration reduce pass-through from wages to prices. We then use industry-level data and find
strong support for these two channels consistent with the implications of our model.
